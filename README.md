## What's this?

CapRover is an extremely easy to use app/database deployment & web server manager for your **NodeJS, Python, PHP, ASP.NET, Ruby, MySQL, MongoDB, Postgres, WordPress (and etc...)** applications!

It's blazingly fast and very robust as it uses Docker, nginx, LetsEncrypt and NetData under the hood behind its simple-to-use interface.

‚úî CLI for automation and scripting

‚úî Web GUI for ease of access and convenience

‚úî No lock-in! Remove CapRover and your apps keep working!

‚úî Docker Swarm under the hood for containerization and clustering

‚úî Nginx (fully customizable template) under the hood for load-balancing

‚úî Let's Encrypt under the hood for free SSL (HTTPS)

### Seriously! Who should care about CapRover?

- A [web] developer who does not like spending hours and days setting up a server, build tools, sending code to server, build it, get an SSL certificate, install it, update nginx over and over again.
- A developer who uses expensive services like Heroku, Microsoft Azure and etc. And is interested in reducing their cost by 50x (Heroku charges 250USD/month for their 2gb instance, the same server is 5$ on Hetzner!!)
- Someone who prefers to write more of `showResults(getUserList())` and not much of `$ apt-get install libstdc++6 > /dev/null`
- A developer who likes installing MySQL, MongoDB and etc on their server by selecting from a dropdown and clicking on install!
- How much server/docker/linux knowledge is required to set up a CapRover server? Answer: Knowledge of Copy & Paste!! Head over to "Getting Started" for information on what to copy & paste ;-)
