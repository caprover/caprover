First of all, thank you for your contribution! 😄

Please make sure you have read [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/caprover/caprover/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-contributing). 



### Most important items

- Make sure to communicate your proposed changes ob our Slack channel beforehand.
- Large PRs (50+ lines of code) will get rejected due to increased difficulty for review - unless they have been communicated beforehand with project maintainers.
- Refactoring work will get rejected unless it's been communicated with project maintainers beforehand.


These rules are strictly enforced to make sure that we can maintain the project moving forward.
